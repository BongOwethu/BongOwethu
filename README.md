 <summary><h3>:woman_technologist: Mandisa's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey as a na√Øve natural science student with a passion to learn everything I could about . I was then introduced to coding when we did computational chemistry on Linux. This is where I began to have an interest in the programming world. I then registered for programming courses and the dropped out due to the work load and balancing school, work and home became a challenge. Then due to financial constraints I was not able to complete my final year, so i decided to work as a lab assistant and the IT help Desk. Then the 2020 pandemic hit. I was now sitting at home and thinking what do I really want to do and which career am I willing to go into. i started researching all the IT related fields which seemed interesting at that time like Data Science, Data Analytic and so on. 2021, had a near death experience that made me realize that life is too short and you will die postponing your dreams. So I began where I left off .I then attended a few bootcamps and then software development reviews and courses to build my coding confidence and skills so that I can see I wanted to start - code, Unix, Linux, theory and all . Slowly but surely I am learning as I go. Challenges, set backs, come-ups and all. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
